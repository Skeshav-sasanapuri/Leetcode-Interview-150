i used a 2 pointer approach
there are simpler ways on the internet that keeps track of min price encoutnerer. 
then, for each price, it compares current max profit with difference between price and min price. replaces max profit if criteria satisfies
the above approach is simple, readable and good.
my approach was probably 2 pointer because i decided to use 2 pointer before completely understanding the problem
it is longer and a little more complex, but it is faster
so what is do is p1 starts at 0 and p2 starts at 1
loop goes on until p2 is less than len of list
at each iteration, i find the difference between price at p2 and p1. 
if difference is negative, p1 becomes p2 and p2 becomes p1 + 1
that means, a new smallest price is found
else increase p2 by 1. then, i compare difference with profit
if difference is greater than profit, i difference my new profit
