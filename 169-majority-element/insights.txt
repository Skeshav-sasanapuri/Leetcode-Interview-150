need to find majority element
this is the element that appears atleast n/2 times in the list where n is the len of list
so more than half the list is majority element
start by declaring 2 variables; count and maj_ele
initially, maj_ele is first element in list. count is set to 1
iterate using for loop from index = 1 to end of list
each time, if element at index = maj_ele, increase count by 1
if it is not equal, decrease count by 1
if count = 0, make the element at current index the maj_ele
return maj_ele at the end.
this logic works because elements try to cancel each other out based on how many times they occur.
the majority element occurs more than n/2 times. so, all the elements together can still not cancel it out. therefore, majority element rules
