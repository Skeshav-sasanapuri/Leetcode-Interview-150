okay, lets goo!! i did this question without any help from the internet
basically, given an array citations where the value of the ith element the number of citations the ith paper has
i need to find the H-index which is the maximum value of h such that there are atleast h papers cited h times
my approach was to first sort it
i then interate over the list
at each iteration, i check if the value of the element in citations is greater than or equal to the number of remaining elements in the list
if yes, return the number of remaining elements as the H index
this works because the list is sorted
if there are only 4 elements remaing
but the value at current iteration is 5
that means the next 4 elements are greater than or equal to 5
going back to the definition of h index
we need h that is there are atleast h papers cited atleast h times
so if there are 4 papers remaining and every remanining citation is greater or equal to than 5
h index cannot be greater than 4
so h index is 4
