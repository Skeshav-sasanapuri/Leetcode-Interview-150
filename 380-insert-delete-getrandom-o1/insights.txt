allrite! lets gooo (fire emoji) (fire emoji) (fire emoji)
i did this by myself while taking minimal help from the internet
i need to implement intert, delete, getRandom within a class with O(1) time complexity each
i could use a set to go about this. But this would let me implement insert and delete but not getRandom
so i need to use a combination of 2 data structutes
the 2 are list and dictionary
list can be used to getRandom at O(1). And dictionary can help in insert and delete in O(1)
in constructor, i initialize dict and list
in insert, it is easy, i check if element is in dict. if not, append it to list. add it to dict such that key is element and the value is the len of list -1 which would be the index of the element in the list
for remove, it is slightly more tricky.
what i need to do is if element need to be removed from list
i need to swap element with last element in list. this would be O(1)
then i pop last element in list which is again O(1)
how i do this is: i have index of element to remove from list
i have last index of list from len of list
now that i have both indexes, i can simply swap using the tuple trick
once swapped, i can pop the last element from the list which is element
but, i also need to pop element from dict as we no longer have it in list
also, the last element in list that was swapped inside, i need to update the index of that in dict. 
this can be done by storing the index of the element from dict, then storing val of the last element in list before swapping
now, use these 2 values to update dict
lastly, get random
just generate random int between 0 and len(list)-1
return val at that index
