need to find if it is possible to reach end of the list
at each index, user can jump a maximum of the value at that index
set max_reachable to 0
iterate through the list
at each loop, if max_reachable is less that the index that could be reach from the current index, set max reachable to this new value
if at anytime, max_reachable is lesser than i (index at the loop), that means this i could never be reach from any of the previous elements
so return false
if loop completes, return true at the end
