need to check and remove dupplicates in a list that occur more than twice
list has been sorted in ascending order
3 pointer approach. But I use only k and i
k starts from 2. this pointer decides what element should be placed at position k
i starts at 2 and moves until end of list
at every i, check if it is not equal to element at k-1 and k-2
if not, place the ith element at k and increment k by 1
